This research examines light verb constructions in Indonesian. While I acknowledge the possibility of prior research on this topic, to the best of my knowledge, dedicated studies on light verb constructions in Indonesian remain scarce. Despite this academic lacuna, such constructions are prevalent in everyday Indonesian, with examples like ‘memberi kuliah’ (to give a lecture), ‘mengambil kesempatan’ (take a chance), and ‘membuat keputusan’ (make a decision) as well as other light verb constructions readily attesting to their common usage. This research aims to address this gap in the literature by providing a detailed account of this pervasive linguistic phenomenon.
