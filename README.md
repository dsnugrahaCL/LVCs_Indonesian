This project centers on examining the formation of light verbs in an agglutinative language, with a particular emphasis on constructions that stem from Bahasa Indonesia (lit. Indonesian).  Procedurally, the present project critically analyzes these constructions through theoretical linguistic approaches and corpus-based methods.  While we acknowledge the possibility of prior research on this topic, to the best of our knowledge, dedicated studies on light verb constructions in Indonesian remain scarce. Despite this academic lacuna, such constructions are prevalent in everyday Indonesian, with examples like ‘memberi kuliah’ (to give a lecture), ‘membawa pesan’ (to carry a message), and ‘mengambil kelas’ (to take a class) readily attesting to their common usage. This research aims to address this gap in the literature by providing a detailed account of this pervasive linguistic phenomenon.
